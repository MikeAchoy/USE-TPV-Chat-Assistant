This directory contains test cases for checking system states. For
each specification there are usually several command files which are
read in producing a system state. The state is checked for model
inherent constraints and OCL invariants. Command files having the word
`good' in their name should produce valid states, those which have the
word `bad' in their name should produce invalid states.
